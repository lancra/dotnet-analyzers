# .NET Analyzers

Provides severity settings for .NET analyzers I've configured for personal use. Also includes any scripts/documentation used to keep
the lists up-to-date and to generate the configuration files to apply the settings to a repository.

## Usage

Run the build script to download rulesets, merge the results with local settings, and output configuration files.

```powershell
./build.ps1
```
